        <h1>Logo Inspiration.</h1>
        <p>
          The inspiration for this logo comes from a simple, minimalist idea. From researching other successful brands, it is clear that the less complicated the logo is, the better.
        </p>
        <h1>How the logo shows what the company is about.</h1>
        <p>
        This logo shows that the company is simple, yet detailed. This can be applied to their chocolate products as well.
        </p>

        <h1>Why the logo is effective for the brand.</h1>
        <p>
        This logo is effective because it provides a clear message, is simple, and can be regonized without having the words accompanied with it.
        </p>

        <h1>How the branding/logo makes us stand out.</h1>
        <p>
        This logo is unlike any other in the chocolatier market. This branding website also stands out to people and competitors because it has a unique, easy to read layout.
